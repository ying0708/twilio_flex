This feature is intended to demonstrate how to use web APIs to select audio devices and apply them for use within Flex, specifically with the Flex Voice Client.

:::caution Deprecated
This feature has been replaced by [the native device manager feature](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/end-user-guide/initial-audio-device-check#how-do-i-switch-audio-devices-public-beta) in Flex UI 2.6 and later. To use the native feature, navigate to Flex > Admin > Features > Beta, and enable the toggle for Device Manager. It will then be visible after reloading Flex.

## Flex User Experience

The Device Manager currently provides options related to audio device selection. Utilizing Twilio Paste components, a list of audio device options is presented to the agent upon clicking the `Icon Button` in the `Main Header` of Flex.

After selecting an audio device, a `Toast notification` is shown to indicate the audio device has been set successfully.

## Setup and Dependencies

There are no additional dependencies for setup beyond ensuring the flag is enabled within the `flex-config` attributes.

To enable the `Device Manager` feature, under the `flex-config` attributes set the `device_manager` `enabled` flag to `true`. You may also separate the output and input device selection by setting `input_select` to `true`.

```json
"device_manager": {
    "enabled": true,
    "input_select": true
}
```
